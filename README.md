# Briskk - Catalyst Animation Experience

## Overview
Briskkkk is an interactive web application built for the Catalyst Animation Hackathon, focusing on creating engaging user experiences through thoughtful animations. The project demonstrates how purposeful animations can enhance user interaction, guide navigation, and communicate state changes effectively.

## Technical Implementation
### Stack
- Catalyst Framework
- Motion for primary animations
- Framer-Motion for complex sequences
- React Spring for parallax scroll
- CSS Animations for basic interactions

### Architecture
- Component-based structure following Catalyst patterns
- Animation Controller layer for managing complex sequences
- Performance-optimized render cycles
- State management for animation coordination

## Design Decisions
### Technical Choices
- React Spring for smooth parallax effect
- Framer-Motion for timeline-based sequences

### Animation Implementation
- Entry/exit micro animations for component transitions
- State-based micro-interactions
- Progressive loading animations
- Gesture-driven interfaces
