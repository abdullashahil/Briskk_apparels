## Overview

Briskkkk is a dynamic apparel e-commerce platform developed for the Catalyst Animation Hackathon. The project showcases purposeful animations that enhance user experience through:

- Smooth product transitions
- Interactive navigation elements
- Visual feedback on user actions
- Engaging state change indicators

The application demonstrates how strategic animation implementation can elevate a standard e-commerce interface into an immersive shopping experience.

## Technical Implementation
### Stack
- Catalyst Framework
- Motion for primary animations
- Framer-Motion for complex sequences
- React Spring for parallax scroll
- CSS Animations for basic interactions

### Architecture
- Component-based structure following Catalyst patterns
- Animation Controller layer for managing complex sequences
- Performance-optimized render cycles
- State management for animation coordination

## Design Decisions
### Technical Choices
- React Spring for smooth parallax effect
- Framer-Motion for timeline-based sequences

### Animation Implementation
- Entry/exit micro animations for component transitions
- State-based micro-interactions
- Progressive loading animations
- Gesture-driven interfaces
